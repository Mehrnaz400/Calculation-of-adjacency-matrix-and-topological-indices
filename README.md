# Calculation-of-adjacency-matrix-and-topological-indices
Step 1: Input the edges matrix or graph connection matrix into the MATLAB software. 

Step 2: Specify the number of graph vertices in the software. 

Step 3: Obtain the adjacency matrix of the graph and the values of the topological indices in the output.
